# forestTrends
Package is a work in progress set of functions that use case bootstrapping methods to assess temporal trends in permanent plots with repeated visits. 
Package was designed to work with forestNETN and forestMIDN datasets, but should work with most datasets that have plot-level visits as rows and variables as columns.
